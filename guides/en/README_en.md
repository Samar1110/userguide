## Hardware Components

A SeedSigner device consists of:

1. **Raspberry Pi Zero** - The main computing unit
2. **Raspberry Pi Camera** - For QR code scanning and entropy capture
3. **WaveShare 1.3inch LCD Hat** - Display and control interface

### WaveShare LCD Hat Controls

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/WaveShare_LCD_Hat.png" alt="WaveShare LCD Hat" width="350"/>
</div>

The WaveShare LCD Hat provides the following controls:

- **Joystick**: Four-directional navigation (Up, Down, Left, Right) plus center press
- **Key1 (A)**: Primary action button
- **Key2 (B)**: Secondary action button  
- **Key3 (C)**: Tertiary action button

### Button Functions Reference

| Control        | Function                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Joystick Up    | Move selection up                           |
| Joystick Down  | Move selection down                         |
| Joystick Left  | Move selection left                         |
| Joystick Right | Move selection right                        |
| Joystick Press | Alternative selection/confirm (context-dependent) |
| Key1 (A)       | Select highlighted option or confirm action |
| Key2 (B)       | Select highlighted option or confirm action |
| Key3 (C)       | Select highlighted option or confirm action |

**Important Navigation Notes**:

- All three keys (A, B, C) function identically for selection and confirmation
- To go back to a previous screen, navigate to the back arrow/button using the joystick first, then press any key to activate it
- The joystick center press may have different functions depending on the current screen context

## üèÅ Conclusion

SeedSigner provides a secure, open-source solution for Bitcoin key management and transaction signing. By following the workflows in this guide, you can:

- ‚úÖ Generate truly random seed phrases using multiple entropy sources
- ‚úÖ Securely load and manage existing seed phrases
- ‚úÖ Sign Bitcoin transactions without exposing private keys to networked devices
- ‚úÖ Export public keys for watch-only wallet setup
- ‚úÖ Verify address ownership and transaction details
- ‚úÖ Maintain complete air-gap security throughout all operations

### Remember the Golden Rules

1. **Never skip seed backup verification** - One wrong word means lost Bitcoin
2. **Always verify transaction details** - Bitcoin transactions are irreversible
3. **Maintain air-gap security** - Never connect SeedSigner to networks
4. **Use private environments** - Protect against surveillance and recording
5. **Store backups securely** - Treat seed phrases like the valuable assets they protect
