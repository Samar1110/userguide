# Initial Setup and Power On

## Starting Your Device

1. **Connect Power**: Use a Micro USB cable to power your SeedSigner
2. **Wait for Boot**: Wait for few seconds for the complete boot sequence
3. **Dismiss Initial Notification**: Press any key (A, B, or C) to dismiss the "You can remove the SD card now" message

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Once the operating system loads into RAM, you can safely remove the SD card. This ensures that seed phrases cannot be accidentally stored on the device, maintaining air-gapped security.
